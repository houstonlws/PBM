# **Account Set Up**

## Creating an Account

When you first visit the frontend application, you will be greeted with the home screen. From here, you can click the "Login" button to be taken to the login screen. If you do not have an account, you can click the "Register" button to be taken to the registration screen.

> **Note:** By default, the database contains an **admin account** with username: `dev@dev.dev` and password: `pass`. You can use these credentials to log in and access the admin dashboard.

## First Time Login

When logging in for the first time or if you have not completed your profile, you will be presented with a form to complete your profile. This form is required to be filled out before you can access the rest of the application.
